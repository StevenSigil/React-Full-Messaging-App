# React Messenger 
## Messaging between users using React and Firebase

---
### Summary
A Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows two or more users to send and receive messages in 'chat rooms' which the user sets up as they wish. Using the [*react-firebase-hooks*](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks) package, the chatrooms are updated with messages and changes in realtime due to the Stateful nature of 'listening' for data.
